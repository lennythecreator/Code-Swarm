What is our goal?
  Our goal is to educate those of all ages about space exploration, our own solar system and Rare space phenomena.
How will we do that?
  We have created a web application that presents the user with different tracks which demonstrates the essential topics that you need to know about space.
  There is also an option that allows for reinforcement learning and enables the user to test their knowledge on what was just learnt.
