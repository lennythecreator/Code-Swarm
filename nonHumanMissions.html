                <p>Apollo 10, launched on May 18, 1969, served as a vital rehearsal for the upcoming Apollo 11 mission, testing all aspects of lunar landing except the actual touchdown. The crew, consisting of Commander Thomas P. Stafford, Command Module Pilot John W. Young, and Lunar Module Pilot Eugene A. Cernan, conducted a lunar module descent, coming within 50,000 feet of the lunar surface. The lunar module, named "Snoopy," successfully redocked with the command module, "Charlie Brown," before returning to Earth.</p>
                <p>The mission lasted a total of 8 days, 3 minutes, and 23 seconds

        <div class="content">
            <div class="pdiv">
                <p>The primary objective of Apollo 11 was to complete a national goal set by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961: perform a crewed lunar landing and return to Earth.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Apollo 11, launched on July 16, 1969, marked the first successful manned lunar landing. The crew, including Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, landed the lunar module, "Eagle," on the Moon's surface in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong took humanity's first steps on the lunar surface, famously stating, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." The mission safely returned to Earth on July 24, 1969, with the command module splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The televised moonwalk to millions all over the world, scientific experiments, and collection of lunar samples were historic achievements, fulfilling President John F. Kennedy's 1961 goal for a crewed lunar landing. Apollo 11's success remains a symbol of human exploration and a monumental milestone in space exploration history.</p>
                <p>The mission lasted a total of 8 days, 3 hours, and 18 minutes</p>

        <div class="content">
            <div class="pdiv">
                <p>Apollo 12, launched on November 14, 1969, was the sixth crewed mission in NASA's Apollo program. Despite a lightning strike during launch, the crew, including Commander Charles "Pete" Conrad, successfully landed the lunar module "Intrepid" close to the Surveyor 3 site on the Moon's surface on November 19, 1969. The mission included two moonwalks by astronauts Charles Conrad and Alan Bean, who conducted experiments, collected lunar samples, and retrieved parts from the Surveyor 3 spacecraft. Notably, Apollo 12 transmitted the first color television from the lunar surface. Returning safely to Earth on November 24, 1969, the crew's precision landing and scientific achievements, including the examination of the Surveyor spacecraft, contributed significantly to lunar exploration and the overall success of the Apollo program.</p>
                <p>The mission lasted a total of 10 days, 4 hours, 36 minutes, and 25 seconds.
